		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p style="font-size:150%;">HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the core language used to create and structure web pages. It forms the fundamental building block of the web, providing the structure and content for websites that are displayed in browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Every webpage you visit, whether it's a simple blog or a complex web application, relies on HTML to organize its text, images, links, and other multimedia elements.

At its heart, HTML uses a system of tags and elements to define the various components of a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and can represent anything from a paragraph of text to an image or hyperlink. Each tag tells the browser how to display the content, helping organize information in a readable, structured way. For example, a tag creates a large heading, while a tag defines a paragraph. HTML is not a programming language, but a markup language, meaning its primary purpose is to describe the content and structure of a document rather than perform logical operations.

HTML is easy to learn and widely accessible, making it the ideal starting point for anyone interested in web development. It's a foundational skill, as web developers and designers use HTML to create the skeleton of a website. Once the structure is established, other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to style the appearance, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. HTML provides the basis for more advanced web technologies and serves as the bedrock for building modern websites.

Whether you're creating a simple personal blog, an interactive portfolio, or a complex web application, mastering HTML is your first step in understanding the web. As you progress, you’ll learn to pair it with other web technologies to build visually appealing and fully functional websites, but everything starts with a solid grasp of HTML’s basic structure and syntax.</p>
		<h2>History of HTML</h2>
			<p style="font-size:150%;">The history of HTML began in 1991 when Tim Berners-Lee created it as a simple markup language to structure web documents for the emerging World Wide Web. The first version, HTML 1.0, included basic tags for formatting text and creating hyperlinks. As the web grew, HTML evolved to handle more complex content.

In 1995, HTML 2.0 was standardized, formalizing features like forms and tables. Over time, new versions like HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.0 introduced elements for multimedia and better design, while the web gained broader functionality. HTML's strict version, XHTML, emerged in the early 2000s but was never fully adopted.

The most significant update, HTML5, was launched in 2014, bringing in modern features such as native support for audio, video, and interactive content, while improving compatibility across devices. Today, HTML continues to evolve as the foundation of the web.</p>
		<h2>HTML5 Features</h2>
			<p style="font-size:150%;">HTML5 introduced several groundbreaking features that modernized web development, making it more efficient and adaptable for today’s interactive and media-rich web. One of the most significant improvements in HTML5 is the introduction of provide a clearer structure to web pages. This not only makes the code more readable for developers but also helps search engines better understand the content for improved SEO.

A major leap forward was the native support for multimedia. With the tags, developers can now embed media directly into web pages without relying on external plugins like Flash, ensuring smooth multimedia playback across all devices and browsers. Additionally, HTML5 introduced the canvas element, which allows developers to draw graphics, animations, and even games directly within the browser using JavaScript. This, along with support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), enables more dynamic and visually rich web experiences.

HTML5 also brought enhancements to form handling, adding new input types such as email, date, and range. These new features help streamline user interactions and validation, making forms more intuitive and user-friendly. Another essential update in HTML5 is its focus on offline capabilities. With features like Web Storage (localStorage and sessionStorage) and Application Cache, web applications can now store data locally on a user’s device, allowing users to access content even when they’re offline.

Furthermore, HTML5 introduced the Geolocation API, enabling web applications to access and utilize a user’s geographic location, opening the door to location-based services and applications like maps and localized content. The  feature, which facilitates real-time communication between browsers and servers, also allows for more interactive experiences, such as real-time messaging and live updates without the need for constant refreshes.

All of these features have helped HTML5 transform the web into a more powerful, flexible, and user-friendly environment for both developers and users alike, ensuring that web applications can be more interactive, responsive, and accessible across different devices.</p><br />
